  - Contained activity, minimal business impact
  - Single host/user, easy mitigation, low likelihood of spread

- Medium
  - Limited spread or potential data exposure
  - Requires moderate remediation effort, monitoring recommended

- High
  - Active compromise likely or sensitive data risk
  - Material impact to operations or customers

- Critical
  - Widespread compromise or major business impact
  - Immediate executive escalation, full incident response mobilization
